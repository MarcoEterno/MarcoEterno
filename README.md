I am a Machine Learning Researcher with a physics background from Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, Italy. 


This file contains:
- A list of my main projects
- A description of the research at Octopus AI, my latest full-time occupation.

# Main Projects

- [**multi-digit recognition**](https://github.com/MarcoEterno/multi-digit-recognition):
  - Skills: Pytorch, CNN, Computer Vision
  - Stage: Completed
  - Description: Trained from scratch a CNN to recognize multi-digit numbers in images. 
  

- [**gpt2**](https://github.com/MarcoEterno/gpt2)
  - Skills: Pytorch, Transformers, Language Models Architectures
  - Stage: Core functionality completed, still experimenting
  - Description: Trained from scratch a GPT2 sized model on my Macbook, and experimented with variations of the architecture

- [**covid-19-testing-improvement**](https://github.com/MarcoEterno/covid-19-testing-improvement)
  - Skills: Biotechnology, Problem solving, Recruiting, Selling
  - Stage: Completed
  - Description: Invented a new testing protocol for Covid-19 that speed 
  up the previous procedure by a factor of 5x. The protocol was successfully tested 
  in the virology lab of Pisa, under the supervision of Professor Pistello.
  Variations of our method are used as a standard testing procedure all over the world.

## Octopus AI
### What is Octopus AI
A collaboration of professors, researchers and companies to experiment
with novel ideas to reach Artificial general intelligence.
### Why the name?
I always found fascinating that Octopuses are so intelligent, given
that our last common ancestor with them predates the genesis of sight
during the cambrian explosion (750 million years vs 500 million years).

They developed intelligence in a completely different way than us, and all other vertebrates. 

I decided to name the project Octopus AI to state the intent of
abandoning the mainstream approach of autoregressive Language models for
a bolder, from scratch approach on how to build intelligent systems.



### How did it start
After having been in management consulting for one year, it was finally 
came the time for me to stop looking at the AI revolution from the sidelines, and
start participating in it. 

After attending some open courses form stanford, the MIT, University of Pisa and Oliver Wyman, 
I wanted to start researching on my own. I soon discovered that doing research on this 
topic is amazing, but is very hard to do it alone. Octopus AI is the way i found to be
completely free in my research agenda, while being able
to exchange ideas and get feedback from other professors, researchers and companies. 

## Main Octopus AI Projects
Here is a list of the Main projects. See full description in the projects section:
- GPT2
- frameformer-architecture
- probabilistic-rnn
- LLM monte carlo tree search
