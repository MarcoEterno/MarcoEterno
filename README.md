I am a Machine Learning Researcher with a physics background from 
Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, Italy. 

in October 2023 I started [Octopus AI](https://github.com/MarcoEterno/octopus-ai), a collaboration of professors, 
researchers and companies to experiment
with novel ideas to reach Artificial general intelligence.


# Main Projects
Projects with the üêô symbol have been made under the Octopus AI collaboration.

- [**multi-digit recognition**](https://github.com/MarcoEterno/multi-digit-recognition):
  - Skills: Pytorch, CNN, Computer Vision, Coding
  - Stage: Completed
  - Description: Trained from scratch a CNN to recognize multi-digit numbers in black and white images.
  

- [**gpt2**](https://github.com/MarcoEterno/gpt2)üêô
  - Skills: Pytorch, Transformers, Language Models Architectures
  - Stage: Core functionality almost completed, still experimenting
  - Description: Trained from scratch a GPT2 sized model on my Macbook, and experimented with variations of the architecture.

- [**covid-19-testing-improvement**](https://github.com/MarcoEterno/covid-19-testing-improvement)
  - Skills: Biotechnology, Problem solving, Recruiting, Selling
  - Stage: Completed
  - Description: Invented a new testing protocol for Covid-19 that speed 
  up the previous procedure by a factor of 5x. The protocol was successfully tested 
  in the virology lab of Pisa.
  Variations of our method are used as a standard testing procedure all over the world.
- [**master-thesis**](https://github.com/MarcoEterno/master-thesis)
  - Skills: Macroeconomics, Econophysics, C, Data Analysis.
  - Stage: Completed
  - Description: Found an optimal fiscal and monetary policy in order to follow any objective of the state. Created a thermodynamic model of the economy where taxes, consumtption and production are taken into account.
- [**frameformer-architecture**](https://github.com/MarcoEterno/frameformer-architecture)üêô
  - Skills: AI Research, Langchain
  - Stage: Core objective reached, still experimenting
  - Description: an attempt to find a novel architecture to reach AGI.
  Built a self-improving LLM agent that leverages the scientific method 
  and experiments to build a model of the world.

- [**probabilistic-rnn**](https://github.com/MarcoEterno/probabilistic-rnn)üêô:
  - Skills: RNNs, stochastic processes
  - Stage: Core idea working, refinements needed
  - Description: Invented a RNN architecture that instead of forgetting past information
  exponentially with the distance does it with a power law behaviour with tunable exponent.

- **llm-monte-carlo-tree-search**üêô :
  - Skills: LLMs, Reinforcement Learning, MCTS
  - Stage: Early stage, main components working (MCTS, Local LLM)
  - Description: An attempt to use MCTS to explore the decoding paths of LLMs and choose the best one.
  This work is analogous to AlphaZero, where chess moves are replaced by word choices, and a game is a sentence.
